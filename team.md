# About us 
After nearly a decade of relentless fundamental research and challenging, innovative experiments, our founding team, ambitious researchers at the University of Santiago de Chile, achieved significant breakthroughs by mastering the synthetic parameters that limit the proper growth of metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals to millimeter sizes. This outstanding know-how is driven by our founders to pave the way for the implementation of MOF crystals in nonlinear photonic technologies, overcoming a major hurdle that has long impeded their application in the photonics industry. 
Nowadays, MAQI stands as a university spin-off company, composed of professionals in physics, chemistry, and engineering with wide experience in the material science and advanced photonic technologies. Our team is committed to driving photonics innovations by offering state-of-the-art solutions through custom-designed optical crystals based on metal-organic frameworks that meet the specific needs of the photonics industry in both industrial and academic sectors. MAQI is driven to become a key player in the global industry of nonlinear optical crystals for advanced photonic applications.
