Years of fundamental research on metal-organic frameworks (MOF) crystals for applications in optics from at Universidad de Santiago de Chile, resulted in breakthroughs in crystal fabrication that enabled the development of MIRO-101, the first bulk MOF crystal for efficient optical frequency conversion, paving the way for introducing MOFs in nonlinear photonics at scale.

MAQI was founded as a university spin-off in 2023, with a dedicated team of physicists, chemists and engineers with combined expertise in material science and advanced photonic technologies. Our team is committed to driving photonics innovations by offering state-of-the-art solutions through custom-designed optical crystals based on MOFs that meet the specific needs of the photonics industry in both industrial and academic sectors. 

We are proud to pioneer the introduction of MOF technology in the global photonics industry for applications in telecommunications, sensing and computing.
